Revenue Trend Analysis (Line Chart)
 Create a line chart to analyze the revenue trend. Use Invoice Date on the x-axis and Revenue (calculated as Quantity Ã— Unit Price) on the y-axis. Ensure the granularity is set to monthly and display data only for the year 2011.

2.  Revenue vs. Quantity by Country (Side-by-Side Bar Chart)
 Create a side-by-side bar chart to compare revenue and quantity for each region. Filter to show only the top 10 countries by revenue and exclude the United Kingdom. Each country should have two bars representing revenue and quantity.

3.Top 10 Customers by Revenue (Column Chart)
 Create a vertical bar chart showing the revenue generated by the top 10 customers. Filter out entries with missing CustomerID and sort customers in descending order by revenue.

4. Units Sold by Country (Map Chart)
 Create a map chart highlighting each country to show the total units sold. Exclude the United Kingdom from the visualization. Ensure that the country name or total units sold is visible for each country.

This dashboard provides an interactive exploration of revenue, quantities sold, and customer engage-  ment across various countries for online retail sales. Key Metrics
